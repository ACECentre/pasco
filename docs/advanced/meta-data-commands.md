# ðŸš€ Meta-Data commands

**'Meta-data'** commands are commands added in-line to the tree file which changes the function of that part of the language. For example, we have commands that stop the tree automatically going back to the top - and commands that help with spelling. For example, If you want to change create a command to go back you would type this in your file

```Animals
	Dog
	Cat
	Bird
	Go Back <meta data-back-n-branch="1">	   			
```

This is the **Control data command - back-n-branch**. This means you can set an action on the press of this command to go back up **n** levels. Maybe one or two branches if necessary.

The following is an example markdown for a metadata in a node

	I have something to say<meta data-audio="some/audio/file.mp3" auditory-cue="<TEXT>">

It's the replacement text for utterance for cue

#### Stay in Branch commands

To stay in a branch simply add this at the top level item:

	<meta data-stay-in-branch>

e.g.

	I would like<meta data-stay-in-branch>
		Pizza
		with Cheese
		with Pepperoni 

To go back one level or several you can use use back-n-branch=N where N = number of branches to step back to. e.g. 

	<meta data-back-n-branch="1" data-back-n-branch-notify>

And lastly, to select an item and then exit use select-utterance

	<meta data-select-utterance>

#### Spell metadata

Spelling is possible. To start it you need a branch that defines a alphabet. So the root node should have `spell-branch`:

	I'll spell it <meta data-spell-branch>
	
To spell a letter use `spell-letter` e.g. `<meta data-spell-letter=" ">`

	spell-letter="<A LETTER>"

It's the replacement for the text existed in that node. Instead this value will be added to list of letters

	spell-finish

The option to delete the last letter selected

	spell-delchar

The option to remove last inserted character in spelling queue

	spell-branch

Considers all leaf of that branch to be as spell letters, It used for defining where spell function should be used.

#### Spelling with prediction


	<meta data-onselect-continue-in-branch data-onselect-continue-concat>

	predict-after-n-chars="number"



#### Audio metadata

	audio="<PATH/TO/AUDIO/FILE>"

Plays the selected audio for cue and main voice

	cue-audio="<PATH/TO/AUDIO/FILE>"

Plays the selected audio for cue voice

	main-audio="<PATH/TO/AUDIO/FILE>"

Plays the selected audio for main voice

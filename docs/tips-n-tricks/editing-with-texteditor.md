# Editing with a Text Editor

Before you edit the raw language file you must remember some rules!

1. Use a **Plain Text editor**. **Don't use Microsoft Word, Wordpad, Apple Pages or similar**. When you have a plain text editor - no fancy formatting like bolding text or underlining is possible. Which is great for pasco - as it will mess with its head!. The only formatting you can use is a tab to indent the text (or use spaces). For example:

		Chat
			Social Chat
				Alright Mate
				How's things?
			Polite Chat
				Good morning
				How are you?
				Anything I can do for you today
		Care Messages
			Body Parts
			Medical equipment
				Chair
				Bed
		I'll spell it

2. **Tabs and Spaces don't mix!** Each line can start with either spaces OR tabs. Not both 

So you cannot do this:

```[space-tab]Chat
[space-space]I'll spell it
```

i.e. here the file has started with a space - but then given a tab. The next line has two spaces. In many text editors this is difficult to see - but effectively we have messed up pasco. Does it look at spaces or tabs? 

3. **Cues can be put in brackets**

for example if you wanted the person to be able to say "Hello World" (Main Voice) but a cue to be "Hello" we could do this:

	Hello World(hello)


## Editing with Notes on iOS

Unless you have a fancy iPad Pro - or are using an external keyboard you cant use tabs on the iPad - so you will **have** to use spaces instead. Where you would use one tab to indent - do the same with a space. Keep the number of spaces the same so your file looks nice and neat.

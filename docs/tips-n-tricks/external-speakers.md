# Using a Private/Cue Speaker or Public/Main Speaker/headphone

pasco is designed to work well with an external headphone or speaker so the person communicating can only hear the cue rather than others in their environment hearing the cue constantly. **Please note. This feature is only available on iOS at present**. To do this plug in a wired headphone or speaker to the device (**it does not work on bluetooth speakers yet!**). When you do this all sound, by default, will now be directed to your headphones. To redirect the Main voice to the speaker of the iPhone/iPad you need to check the box to **redirect the output** in the **Config**\->**Speech**.
